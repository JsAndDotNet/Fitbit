# Use of Fitbit for Post Covid Fatigue Rehabilitation

> This method is free to use and derive as you so wish. I (Justin Jones, UK South) would appreciate being credited with the original model. I take no responsibility for its' use.

## Purpose

To provide a technique to help people recover from Post Covid Fatigue. 

A key feature is that it helps avoid the 'Boom and Bust' pattern associated with fatigue related recoveries.

## Pre Requisites

For this technique, a fitness tracker (such as a Fitbit) is required.

## Timespan

This is not a 'quick fix'. Convalescence takes time. That said, I noticed significant changes within 2 weeks.

## Method

### Step 1 - Guage Current Activity

1. Spend 2-3 days doing what you are currently doing to guage how active you really are. Try to notice WHEN you are being active. DO NOT push yourself during these days.

2. Take note of the number of steps certain activities take. E.g. Getting breakfast = 83 steps. Walk to shops = approx 900 steps. This will help spread the load in step 2.


### Step 2 - Try to spread activity through the day

1. Set a specific wake time (6-8am?)

2. Use the [Steps Table Guide Below](#how-to-use the-steps-table) below to spread your activity out during the day at the existing level. Aim for the current number of steps, but spread evenly through the day.

**NOTE: The table is the key point of this whole method. It is a target to match, NOT a target to beat!** 


### Step 3 - Gradually Increase the number of steps

## My Experience/ Results

# Step 1

I thought I was doing nothing, but in fact I was doing around 1,000 steps a day. My pattern was doing nothing most of the day, feeling better, then being active.
