# Use of Fitbit for Post Covid Fatigue Rehabilitation (Avoiding Boom and Bust)

> This method is free to use and derive as you so wish. I ([Justin Jones](https://twitter.com/JsAndDotNet), UK South) would appreciate being credited with the original model. I take no responsibility for it, or derivations of it, in any way whatsoever.


# TLDR - Quick Start

The principle is simple:

1. Gauge comfortable baseline number of steps (1-2 days)
2. Use [the tables here](#how-to-use-the-steps-table) as **a guide to spread activity through the day**. Try to keep in range. If you've hit the steps too early, make sure you rest! Don't worry too much if you're under, but try to get near :relaxed: . 

3. Build up the number of steps carefully, keeping in line with the steps/time guide.

# Full Description

## Purpose

To provide a technique to help people recover from Post Covid Fatigue. 

The *key feature* is that it helps avoid the 'Boom and Bust' pattern associated with fatigue related recoveries.

The intention is for this to be used in conjunction with other rehabilitation techniques.

## Pre Requisites

For this technique, a fitness tracker (such as a Fitbit) is required.

Ideally you would already have a fitbit and know your pre-covid activity levels (e.g. a work day = 9000 steps), however this is not essential.

## Timespan

This is not a 'quick fix'. Convalescence takes time. That said, I noticed significant changes within 2 weeks.

## Method

### Step 1 - Gauge Current Activity

1. Spend 1-2 days doing what you are currently doing to gauge how active you really are. Try to notice WHEN you are being active. DO NOT push yourself during these days. **You need to find a baseline you can manage**.

2. Take note of the number of steps certain activities take. E.g. Getting breakfast = 83 steps. Walk to shops = approx 900 steps. This will help spread the load in step 2. My wife paced out certain activities for me, so I didn't have to do them to know what was required.


### Step 2 - Try to spread activity through the day

1. Set a specific wake time (6-8am?)

2. Use the [Steps Table Guide](#how-to-use-the-steps-table) below, or print [Steps Calculator.xlsx](https://github.com/JsAndDotNet/Fitbit/blob/main/Steps%20Calculator.xlsx) to guide spreading your steps out during the day at the existing level. Aim for the current number of steps, but spread evenly through the day.

**NOTE: The table is the key point of this whole method. It is a target to match, NOT a target to beat! This means, if you have hit your target too early - you should rest!** 


### Step 3 - Gradually Increase the number of steps

1. Determine your next level of steps. Be cautious to start. There's nothing wrong with aiming for 50 or 100 more steps in a day! Do what feels right. As your baseline gets higher, you might be able to make the increments bigger.

2. Stick to the [Steps Table Guide](#how-to-use-the-steps-table) even if you feel well. If you think you can bump up the number of steps, set that as the target for tomorrow, not today! 

### Notes

- Fatigue may take up to 3 days to surface, so caution is key. 

- Steps are not the be-all-and-end-all. It's good to get them up to a decent level for a feeling of getting back to normal, but you will need cardio and strengthening exercises too.

- You may hit plateau's (times when you get stuck at a level - I did at 5K and 7K). Don't worry. If you're not ready to move on, don't try to push through. You may find you're actually doing more of other activities that don't involve many steps, but is still exertion (e.g. cooking).

- Other activities can be considered a replacement for steps. If you've done some Tai Chi for example, that's not many steps, but it is exertion on the body that may reduce your number of steps for the day. You have to be honest with yourself here to ensure you don't tire yourself out.

- Multiple small walks spread out over the day are much better than one big walk!

- Increasing your pace when walking can be a good way of increasing cardio work, without doing more steps. Be careful :relaxed:.

### How to Use the Steps Table

The main idea is to spread steps out through the day.


- It's a target to match, not a target to beat.
- Don't be too specific - a bit over or under is fine :relaxed:
- If you are over the number of steps - take some rest until later.
- If you are under, you may want to do a little more to keep the spread even.


#### Lower Steps

#### Higher Steps Adjusted


At >7-8K steps, you may need to make adjustments to the tables to move steps towards the earlier part of the day, to allow for evening rest e.g. :

|Time(24hr)&darr;/Steps&rarr; | 10000 | 
| ----                        | ---  | 
| 1000                        | 2500  |
| 1200                        | 5000  |
| 1600                        | 8500  |
| 2000                        | 10000  |




## My Experience/ Results

> NOTE: Do not compare your progress with other people. Everyones body is different - Do what's right for you!

> NOTE 2: I found the tables worked better than a '% Complete App' (such as the 'Loops' Clock on Fitbit Versa 2). The tables were instrumental in making sure the steps were *SPREAD OUT*.

> NOTE 3: For strengthening exercises and mental health, I used this excellent [Long Covid Rehab Guide From Nuffield](/covid-rehab-journal.pdf).


### Background

My pattern had been doing nothing most of the day, feeling better, then being too active. My comfort level was 1,000 steps, but when I tried to exercise, my walk was 700 steps - nearly 75% of what I could manage in a day. Clearly a recipe for boom and bust! I was stuck in a boom and bust cycle for several weeks until I started using this plan.


### Step 1

I thought I was doing nothing, but in fact I was doing around 1,000 steps a day comfortably. 


### Step 2

I started using the tables above and spreading my steps out over the day. My inital target was 1200 steps. I was tired, but not completely smashed.

### Step 3

I then continued to use the tables above (checking in at 10am, 12pm, 4pm, 8pm) and gradually tried increasing the steps.

Here are the results:

| Day  | Steps (approx) |
| ---- | ----- |
| 1    | 1200  |
| 2    | 1500  |
| 3    | 2000  |
| 4    | 2000  |
| 5    | 2700  |
| 6    | 3700 <sup>1</sup>|
| 7    | 3500  |
| 8    | 5000 <sup>2</sup>|
| 9    | 4000  |
| 10    | 4500  |
| 11    | 6300  |
| 12   | 6500  |
| 13   | 6800  |
| 14   | 7200  |
| 15   | 7000  |
| 16   | 6300 <sup>3</sup>  |
| 17   | 6000 <sup>4</sup>  |
| 18   | 8500   |
| 19   | 6400 <sup>5</sup>  |
| 20   | 8500 <sup>6</sup>  |
| 21   | 9500   |


1. Was aiming for 3.5k, but went a bit over
2. This jump was too much and resulted in building back up.
3. Did an exercise class for 30 mins, so aimed for lower steps to avoid exhaustion.
4. Went clothes shopping with family. Was standing around a lot, so lower steps.
5. Did an exercise class (30 mins), a very brisk walk, and started Tai Chi (20 mins - hard on the legs!).
6. Including a walk around town and 2 brisk walks.

From week four I was managing >10K steps/day every day. I still had long covid issues (leg pain/ aches and tired), but I was able to live a more normal life at this point.

I did stretches 2-3 times a day (calves, quads, hamstrings). I also feel this helped.

## Overall

Overall, this technique has proved a good framework to help build back up following Covid.
